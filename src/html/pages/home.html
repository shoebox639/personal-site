    <h2>So who am I?</h2>
    <p>
      My passion for programming started in high school, when I wanted to learn how to make all the video games I was playing.
      Since then, I've seen every problem as an opportunity for me to solve it with software.
      I love problem solving, and I'm not satifisfied until I arrive at an elegant solution. 
      I'm now a lead software engineer at <a href="http://www.yodle.com">Yodle</a>, where I've been since 2010.
