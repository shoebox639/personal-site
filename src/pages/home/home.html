  <h2>So who am I?</h2>
  <p>
    My passion for programming started in high school, when I wanted to learn how to make all the video games I was playing.
    Since then, I have loved problem solving and looking for that elegant solution.
    I'm now a lead software engineer at <a href="http://www.ordergroove.com">OrderGroove</a>, where I've been since 2016.
